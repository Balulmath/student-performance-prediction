# 🎓 Student Performance Prediction

This project predicts high school student math scores using various regression models and visual analyses.

## 📁 Dataset
Source: [Kaggle - Student Performance in Exams](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams)  
Columns:
- Gender, Race/Ethnicity, Parental Level of Education
- Lunch, Test Preparation Course
- Math, Reading, Writing Scores

## 🔍 Objective
To build predictive models that estimate a student’s math performance and evaluate them using error metrics.

## 🧪 Models Used
- Linear Regression
- Ridge & Lasso Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- K-Nearest Neighbors

## 📈 Metrics Evaluated
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

## 📊 Visualizations
- MSE & MAE comparison bar plots
- Predicted vs Actual scatter plot
- Residual error distribution
- Feature importance (Random Forest)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python, Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Pandas
